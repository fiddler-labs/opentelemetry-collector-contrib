The Fiddler receiver ingests metrics data from [Fiddler](https://docs.fiddler.ai/) and converts it into the OTLP metric format.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:
- `endpoint`: The URL where Fiddler is deployed for your organization.
- `token`: Your authorization token from the Fiddler Settings page under the Credentials tab.

The following settings are optional:
